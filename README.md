# Animated Short Story

## Saito and the Incorrigible Haru's Ridiculous Tour

This is a short story that I've written and am attempting to animate. The completed version of this project will (hopefully) provide a responsive animated SPA that uses ideal typography and also pulls in text from simple markdown documents.

## Updating Animation

The older version of this project utilized Jquery, ScrollMagic and TweenMax. I intend to convert all of this to standalone vanilla JS (possibly using TS) and SCSS.
